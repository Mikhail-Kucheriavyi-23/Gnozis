# R2 Durable Recovery -> Replay -> Continue — 2026-09-26

## End-to-end contract

The persistence boundary is now tested through the complete recovery path:

`Commit -> injected process stop -> durable DB -> Reload -> Replay -> Verify -> Continue Commit`

A process stop after SQLite `COMMIT` is not treated as a failed semantic commit merely because the caller did not receive the return value. Recovery reads the durable history, replay reconstructs the state, and the next causal transition can continue from that recovered state.

## Adversarial condition

The same end-to-end path must fail closed when a persisted record claims a state hash that does not match the state reconstructed by its replay applier.

## Evidence

The integration tests cover:

- post-commit process-stop simulation;
- reopening the SQLite database;
- replay of the durable history;
- continuation with the next causally linked record;
- full replay after continuation;
- rejection when replay produces a state different from the persisted state hash.

## Boundary

This proves the Core persistence/replay contract at the application level. It does not prove physical power-loss durability, filesystem hardware behavior, or OS-level storage guarantees.
