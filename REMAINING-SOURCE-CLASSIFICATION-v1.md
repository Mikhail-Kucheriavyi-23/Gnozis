## Non-canonical / unresolved

No source directory is deleted from Gnozis until its target copy is verified and its canonical owner is recorded.

research_machine/ is explicitly Research-Memory, not Core runtime.

gnosis-terminal-bridge/ is explicitly Exchange, not Core.

Public Gnozis must not contain Genesis-private implementation.

## Next transfer order

1. research_machine/ -> Research-Memory
2. gnosis-terminal-bridge/ + bot.py -> Exchange, security review
3. Core implementation/formal/tests/tools -> Core
4. Core/public docs split
5. CI/workflow split
6. final source de-duplication only after verification
