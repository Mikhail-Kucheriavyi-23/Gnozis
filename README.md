# GNOZIS

## Public registry of machine-generated opportunities, contracts and evidence

**Gnozis** is the public product and evidence surface of a system designed to turn technical requirements into specialized, testable modules and partner-ready opportunities.

The production factory behind this surface is **Genesis**. Genesis is intended to remain a protected engineering environment rather than the primary public interface.

Gnozis is where selected outputs become inspectable: proposals, contracts, modules, evidence, provenance and partnership opportunities.

> **Genesis produces. Gnozis exposes, verifies and records.**

                           ▼

```

The public repository is therefore not intended to expose the protected factory itself. It exposes the **results and evidence that are appropriate to share**.

## What Gnozis is building

The long-term product direction is a controlled machine-production cycle:

```text
Technical brief
      ↓
Requirement formalization
      ↓
Specialized module creation
      ↓
Adaptation / learning
      ↓
Independent evaluation
      ↓
Regression and security gates
      ↓
Controlled release
      ↓
Runtime evidence
      ↓
Commercial / partner opportunity
```

The four levels must remain distinct:

1. **Factory creation** — Genesis creates a specialized candidate.
2. **Module adaptation** — the candidate may be configured, trained, supplied with knowledge, or otherwise adapted within an authorized scope.
3. **Module operation** — the released module performs bounded tasks.
4. **Factory/Core evolution** — changes to the protected factory or its governing mechanisms require a separate authority and evidence chain.

Creating autonomous modules does **not** automatically grant the factory permission to rewrite its own protected core.

## Public opportunity catalogue

Gnozis is intended to expose machine-generated opportunities in a form that testers, researchers, partners and potential investors can inspect.

A proposal can progress through evidence stages such as:

```text
EARLY
  ↓
RESEARCH
  ↓
VALIDATED
  ↓
COMMERCIAL
```

These are **maturity/evidence stages, not rankings**. A higher stage means that a different level of evidence and readiness has been established; it does not mean that one proposal is inherently more valuable than another.

Example catalogue entry:

```text
GZ-C-0042
Data Normalization Module

TYPE
Data Processing

STAGE
Validated

EVIDENCE
✓ Functional evaluation
✓ Holdout evaluation
✓ Regression checks
✓ Provenance

STATUS
Open for pilot

CAPABILITIES
• structured data transformation
• schema validation

LIMITATIONS
• bounded execution environment
• no unrestricted external network
```

The exact registry schema and status vocabulary are part of the evolving product contracts.

---

## Contracts

A Gnozis contract is a machine-readable description of a proposed capability, module, partnership or other bounded commitment.

A contract may include:

- contract identifier and version;
- requirements and acceptance criteria;
- allowed capabilities;
- limitations and budgets;
- provenance;
- evaluation evidence;
- artifact identifiers;
- status and lifecycle;
- applicable trust and data boundaries.

Where appropriate, contracts and evidence can be represented by cryptographic hashes so that a particular version can be independently identified.

Example:

```text
Contract ID:       GZ-C-0042
Contract version:  1.2
Module artifact:   <hash>
Evidence root:     <hash>
Provenance root:   <hash>
```

A hash identifies a specific artifact or evidence state. It does not by itself prove that the underlying claim is true; the evidence and verification process remain separate.

---

## Evidence before claims

Gnozis separates:

```text
Documentation
    ≠
Source
    ≠
Test
    ≠
CI evidence
    ≠
Runtime evidence
    ≠
Audit
```

Likewise:

```text
CHANGE
  ≠
IMPROVEMENT
```

A candidate module must not be presented as improved merely because its code changed or because it passed a known test set.

The intended evaluation model includes:

- preserved baselines;
- independent or hidden holdout cases where practical;
- adversarial cases;
- regression checks;
- security and capability boundaries;
- resource limits;
- runtime observations;
- provenance linking source → learning → artifact → evaluation.

Failed candidates are evidence too. A rejected candidate should remain traceable rather than silently replacing the baseline.

---

## Partner data boundary

Partner data is not automatically global learning material.

```text
ACCESS
  ≠
COPY
  ≠
TRAIN
  ≠
PUBLISH
  ≠
REUSE
```

Partner information may remain private to an agreed trust boundary. Eligibility for learning, reuse or publication requires an explicit policy and provenance path.

The intended learning boundary is:

```text
Partner / Research Material
            ↓
     Eligibility Check
            ↓
       Authorized scope
            ↓
      Learning / Adaptation
            ↓
       Independent evaluation
            ↓
        Evidence / result
```

Unknown provenance or unknown permission is not treated as permission by default.

---

## Research-Memory

**Gnozis-Research-Memory** is the machine-readable research and context layer associated with the product.

Its role is to preserve and organize:

- research material;
- historical project context;
- mathematical models;
- formal definitions and contracts;
- evidence and provenance;
- AI-readable context;
- candidate knowledge for future implementation.

Research-Memory is **not itself the authority for changing Genesis**. It supplies structured context and candidate material subject to the relevant contracts and gates.

The intended relationship is:

```text
Gnozis-Research-Memory
          ↓
 candidate knowledge / evidence
          ↓
      eligibility
          ↓
        Genesis
          ↓
     generated outputs
          ↓
       Gnozis
```

## Public repository vs protected factory

The product deliberately separates public visibility from protected execution.

### Public: Gnozis

- opportunity catalogue;
- contracts;
- selected modules;
- evidence;
- provenance;
- research-facing materials;
- partnership surface.

### Research: Gnozis-Research-Memory

- machine-readable research;
- historical context;
- mathematical corpus;
- evidence archive;
- development context.

### Protected: Genesis

- module factory;
- controlled generation;
- learning/adaptation pipeline;
- internal orchestration;
- protected evolution mechanisms.

The protected factory should not be treated as the public product interface.

## Commercial pathway

The intended commercial path is:

```text
Machine-generated proposal
        ↓
Evidence
        ↓
Partner review
        ↓
Pilot
        ↓
Validated module
        ↓
Commercial contract
        ↓
Deployment / partnership
```

The public repository is designed to answer practical questions before a partnership:

- What was proposed?
- What was actually tested?
- Which version produced the evidence?
- What capabilities are allowed?
- What limitations exist?
- What failed?
- What was learned?
- Which contract is being offered?
- What can a partner test?

Commercial readiness is not inferred from the existence of documentation or a repository. It requires evidence from the relevant pilot, evaluation and contractual process.

---

## Current status

This repository describes the **target public product architecture** as it is being formalized. Some parts of the public registry, autonomous module factory, learning pipeline, partner workflow and commercial lifecycle remain under implementation and verification.

Do not interpret the presence of a documented workflow as proof that the complete end-to-end workflow is already operational.

For implementation status and evidence, consult the current repository artifacts and project contracts.

---

## Development principle

> Produce a bounded candidate. Preserve its provenance. Test it independently. Record what happened. Only then promote it.

```text
FACTORY → produces candidates
EVIDENCE → establishes what happened
CONTRACT → defines what is allowed
GNOZIS → exposes verified opportunities
PARTNERS → decide what to adopt
```
