# GNOZIS — EVOLUTION RECORD

This document separates historical development from the current state. Historical formulations are not automatically current requirements. Detailed recovery material is maintained in `GNOZIS_MASTER_AUDIT.md`.

## Phase 1 — Ψ intuition
The project began as a search for a minimal framework capable of representing processes in terms of state, relations, information transformation and evolution. Phenomenological observations were treated as prompts for formalization rather than evidence.

## Phase 2 — Ψ minimalization
Several formulations were explored. The lineage progressively moved toward:

`Ψ = (X,R)`

The purpose was to avoid making derived mechanisms fundamental before establishing the smallest useful state/relation substrate.

## Phase 3 — Endogenous evolution
The central question became whether evolution can be represented internally rather than as repeated external correction:

`X_(n+1) = E(X_n)`

The research then extended this idea to state/rule-state formulations and local dependence.

## Phase 4 — Generate / Test / Select
A concrete computational pattern emerged:

`Generate → Test → Select → Evolve`

Selection must operate only on candidates that passed the relevant test. This became an explicit software contract.

## Phase 5 — Adversarial purification
The project focused on eliminating hidden external operators: human confirmation, external selectors, global observers and hidden metadata that could secretly determine the fundamental transition.

Extensionality became an explicit test target: identical fundamental `(X,R)` projections should not produce different fundamental results merely because auxiliary hidden metadata differs.

A hidden-state counterexample then exposed the limitation of treating `(X,R)` as universally complete without conditions. This result is preserved as a constraint on the minimal-core claim.

## Phase 6 — UROBOROS / Ψ-Core
The ideas were translated into a small computational implementation: State, Relation, Engine, evolutionary transition and UROBOROS recursive wrapper. This became the basis for reproducible software experiments.

## Phase 7 — GNOSIS public baseline
On 2026-09-03 the repository published GNOSIS as a public research platform with UROBOROS / Ψ-Core v33 as the reference baseline. Implemented behavior is separated from unvalidated research architecture.

## Phase 8 — 2026-09-08 baseline freeze
The repository recorded an evolution baseline requiring preservation of endogenous state evolution, Generate/Test/Select integrity, internal selection, reproducibility and separation between AI interfaces and the core.

## Phase 9 — September adversarial validation
From 2026-09-02 onward, the work broadened into mathematical and architectural audits. External/third-party critiques were used to expose hidden-state, extensionality, observer/selector, global-clock, external-correction, locality and autonomy weaknesses. The response was to make dependencies explicit and distinguish software contracts from scientific claims.

Recovered research branches include:

- memory as transformed state/history;
- extended state `Y=(X,ρ)` when rule evolution must be explicit;
- internal model `φ`;
- prediction/reconstruction/contradiction roles `P/R/E`;
- multiple possible world trajectories;
- Gnozis as an evolving coherence/coordination layer rather than a fixed constant;
- protected internal memory and Living Context;
- External Envelope and explicit provenance/authority boundaries;
- secure bridge and Internet Port;
- interoperability as relation-preserving translation rather than shared ontology.

## Phase 10 — Secure interoperability track
The operational architecture developed a protected bridge/Internet Port with challenge binding, replay protection, expiration, fail-closed behaviour, identity/provenance propagation and explicit authority boundaries.

Key trust rule:

`Peer Claim ≠ Authority`

A proposed interoperability port is represented conceptually as:

`P_Ψ = (Schema, Mapping, Contract, Evidence)`

Interoperability is relation-preserving translation rather than an assumption of shared ontology. Task-specific semantic kernels and explicit uncertainty/loss are required where translation is not exact.

## Phase 11 — Memory / Living Context track
Memory was separated from ordinary logging. Working principle:

`M = H(trajectory)`

Memory is a transformed trace of past states unless an explicit model makes it part of future dynamical state. Protected internal memory was discussed as an operational security layer for continuity and integrity; the exact earlier cryptographic construction must be recovered from historical chat material before being declared implemented.

The living-state hierarchy is:

`PROJECT_STATE.md → GNOZIS_MASTER_AUDIT.md → EVOLUTION/PHILOSOPHY/ARCHITECTURE/CLAIMS/ROADMAP → CHANGELOG + code + tests`

## Phase 12 — Current consolidation
The project is moving from version-driven experimentation toward a living-state architecture. The immediate objective is one authoritative project state, preservation of historical failures, and a verified baseline for every future experiment.

Recent executable contracts recorded as GREEN:

```text
Stage 3A  R evolution contract          GREEN
Stage 3B  endogenous R generation       GREEN
Stage 4   closed reproducibility        GREEN
Stage 5A  locality contract             GREEN
Stage 5B  independent state             GREEN
Stage 5C  adversarial locality          GREEN
Stage 6   causal closure                GREEN
Stage 7A  memory provenance             GREEN
```

These are computational regression results, not universal mathematical proofs.

## Historical discipline
Every future change must answer:

1. What invariant does it preserve?
2. What new evidence motivates it?
3. What old mechanism does it replace?
4. Which claims change status?
5. Which tests must be rerun?
6. Does complexity increase or decrease?
7. Does it introduce hidden state, external authority or an undeclared global dependency?
8. Does it belong in the mathematical core, protected operational envelope, or interface layer?

No historical version is authoritative merely because it has a larger version number.
